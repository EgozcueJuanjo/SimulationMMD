# SimulationMMD
This repository contains R-scripts (functions) for simulation of multinomial-multinomial samples. 

The file  rMMD-rMAN.R contains two R-functions for simulation of MMD (Multinomial-Multinomial Distribution) and MAN (Multinomial 
Asymptotic Normal) samples. After these functions there is an example of use of these functions. 
In the example presented you can generate the output simulated samples similar to those in simMMD-out.csv  simMAN-out.csv .
The pattern of zeros is visualized in simMMD-pattern.pdf, simMAN-pattern.pdf using the corresponding function in R-package 
zCompositions.

These functions were introduced in
